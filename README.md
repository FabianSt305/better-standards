# Better Standards

There are lots of standards people follow that aren't the best, but people follow them anyway because it's too costly to switch.

Arguments against switching to the metric system involve the cost of switching away from US units.

The PAL standard for analog television broadcasting was invented with improvements over NTSC, yet the US never transitioned off NTSC, due to the cost associated with doing so.

I like to think about standards, and try and understand:

*Are we following a certain standard because its the best, or out of tradition?*

Over time, I've found a list of standards / policies that we are following out of tradition, and would greatly benefit if we were to switch to a better standard.

## Voting

Tradition: [Plurality Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting)

Better Standard: [Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)

According to [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law), a plurality system marginalizes smaller political parties, generally resulting in a two-party system. 

We should have as many potential political parties as possible.

The more parties there are, the more choices people have.

And more parties, means the amount of bribes (political contributions), will be spread thin on all of the parties.

I feel Approval Voting is better than others. CGP Grey makes a good argument why with his [analogy of finding a place where to eat](https://youtu.be/orybDrUj4vA?t=9).

Why we haven't switched yet: Politicians in power, would lose power by diluting it to other parties.

## Taxing

Tradition: Sales Tax / VAT, Income Tax, Capital Gains, Property Tax

Better Standard: [Georgism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism), [Land Value Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax)

Most taxes distort economic decisions and suppress beneficial economic activity.

Sales taxes will cause products to cost more, or products to not sell at all.

Georgistic taxes will tax monopolistic assets (Land, electromagnetic spectrum, copyright/patents), causing owners to use the resource more efficiently. It has positive externalities.

Why we haven't switched yet: Land would be signficantly cheaper if people had to pay high taxes for its ownership. Current land owners wouldn't like that. And Land owners are powerful.

## Welfare

Tradition: Subsidized housing, Government run schools, Minimum wage requirements

Better Standard: [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)

## Radix

Tradition: [Decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)

Better Standard: [Heximal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senary)
