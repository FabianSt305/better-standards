# Better Standards

There are lots of standards people follow that aren't the best, but people follow them anyway because it's too costly to switch.

Arguments against switching to the metric system involve the cost of switching away from US units.

The PAL standard for analog television broadcasting was invented with improvements over NTSC, yet the US never transitioned off NTSC, due to the cost associated with doing so.

I like to think about standards, and try and understand:

*Are we following a certain standard because its the best, or out of tradition?*

Over time, I've found a list of standards / policies that we are following out of tradition, and would greatly benefit if we were to switch to a better standard.

## Voting

**Tradition**: [Plurality Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting)

**Better Standard**: [Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting)

According to [Duverger's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law), a plurality system marginalizes smaller political parties, generally resulting in a two-party system. 

We should have as many potential political parties as possible.

The more parties there are, the more choices people have.

And more parties, means the amount of bribes (political contributions), will be spread thin on all of the parties.

I feel Approval Voting is better than others. CGP Grey makes a good argument why with his [analogy of finding a place where to eat](https://youtu.be/orybDrUj4vA?t=9).

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Politicians in power, would lose power by diluting it to other parties.

## Taxing

**Tradition**: Sales Tax / VAT, Income Tax, Capital Gains, Property Tax

**Better Standard**: [Georgism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism), [Land Value Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax)

Most taxes distort economic decisions and suppress beneficial economic activity.

Sales taxes will cause products to cost more, or products to not sell at all.

Georgistic taxes will tax monopolistic assets (Land, electromagnetic spectrum, copyright/patents, domain names), causing owners to use the resource more efficiently. It has positive externalities.

The government should send people a request for payment. People should not need to fill out a tax form declaring how much they'd have to pay. There should be no exceptions for lower tax payment.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Land would be signficantly cheaper if people had to pay high taxes for its ownership. Current land owners wouldn't like that. And Land owners hold power in government planning.

## Welfare

**Tradition**: Subsidized housing, Government run schools, Minimum wage requirements

**Better Standard**: [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Fear of some people inappropriately using the money.

## Identification

**Tradition**: ID number written on a card. (Social security number, credit card number, passport number, etc.)

**Better Standard**: Passworded identification. Each ID must have an associated password. No-one should be able to make any changes to a person's record, simply using the ID. A password must be required to verify identity. This password must not be stored by any commercial organization, and must be asked for each time a change needs to be made.

In the United States, some people continue to reject the concept of an Identity Card, preferring to have the ability to remain anonymous. On the federal level, no formal personal form of identification was made. Passports are for traveling outside of the United States. Drivers licenses are for driving. Citizens can live without passports or drivers licenses. As a consequence, (because the US still needs some way to track people, especially for taxation), an informal form of identification (the social security card), became the defacto standard Identity card.

Now the Social Security Number has been used for everything imaginable. From a verification when subscribing to internet service, to recording bankruptcy, loans, and home deeds.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Adding password protection to the social security card, will mean people will have to admit that it is an Identity Card... Some citizens are not ready to make that change.

## Healthcare Payment

**Tradition**: The place where you work, pays every month to a health insurance company. When you need to go to the doctor, the insurance company pays the doctor.

**Better Standard**: The place where you work should pay every month directly to the employee's doctor, regardless if they are sick or not. Under normal circumstances, the patients should not need to pay anything when visiting their doctor.

In a traditional payment system, a doctor will be payed more if a patient needs to come back to the office multiple times for a reoccuring problem.

If instead the doctor gets payed constantly, regardless if sick or not, it is in the doctor's best interest to keep their patients not sick all the time.

Removing the insurance company greatly simplifies the payment system, bringing down the cost of healthcare.

The employee should be able to choose and switch to any doctor they want, at any time.

Because they're being paid all the time from healthy patients, doctors should be proactively trying to make sure their patents stay health, by running various blood tests, perscribing vitamins in advance.

Doctors can do short term personalized drug testing on their healthy patients, to check for side effects. That way if the patents get sick, the doctor will know which drugs they can give didn't have side effects in previous personalized testing.

Short term drugs include: Sleeping Pills, Anohetamines, and Ciprofloxacin.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Health Insurance companies wouldn't like this, and they hold power in government planning.

## Intellectual Property

**Tradition**: An organization *buys* and *owns* a patent or copyright for a certain amount of time. During this time, no-one can make products that use the intellectual property, without permission or paying royalties to the owner.

**Better Standard**: An organization should only be able to *rent time* for their exclusivity over a patent or copyright. The longer some intellectual property is rented, the more expensive it should become.

Initial rent should be extremely low cost, potentially free, as an incentive for inventers to patent their own works, instead of depending on large organizations.

The increase of rent payment over time should influence intellectual property owners to make use of their patent or copyright instead of just squating on it, waiting for royalties.

If the "ownership" of the intellectual property switches hands, or if there is a gap between rent, the rent will continue to be the same, increasing over time.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Some powerful organizations own millions of old patents and copyrights. Switching from a ownership model to a rent model would make these organizations pay significantly more. These organizations would not like that, and they hold power in government planning.

## Radix

**Tradition**: [Decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)

**Better Standard**: [Heximal](https://github.com/veniamin-ilmer/better-standards/tree/master/base-6)

What is the best radix? - Is a question through about for a long time..

e is considered the [most space efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_economy), but is quite inconvenient to use.

Anyway, humans don't seem to need to save more space like machines, for bigger radix numbers.

I think I finally found what I was looking for with base 6, based on how humans naturally use numbers.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Tradition. Not enough awareness of alternative.

## Road Design

**Tradition**: Square / Rectangular Grid Patterns

**Better Standard**: [Hexagonal](http://web.mit.edu/ebj/www/Hexagonal.pdf)

Ideally with road design, we'd want to minimize the amount of road, and maximize the amount of area that the road gets us to.

A honeycomb hexagonal design maximizes the area, and minimizes the perimeter. Doing this should lower the amount of roads we require, and hence minize road cost.

A purely hexagonal road tilling means that only 3 roads join at an intersection (instead of a usual four way intersection with square grid).

If you chart out all the turns of a four way intersection, there are 16 possible collision points inside.

In a three way intersection, there are only 3 possible collision points inside.

[See example road layouts](hexagonal)

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Tradition. Not enough awareness of alternative.

## Timekeeping

**Tradition**: Time varies depending on your geographical position on earth. Time zones and daylight savings time is used.

**Better Standard**: Everyone adapt [Universal Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time)

Without timezones and daylight savings time, time tracking would be significantly easier.

You'd just have to remember at what time are people awake in different parts of the world.

**Why we haven't switched yet**: Tradition. Not enough awareness of alternative.
