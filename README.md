# Number Popularity

I think our base 10 number system, is not the most optimal for our [subitizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing) minds to handle.

Yes, we have 10 fingers, but you can learn to use those fingers to count in different bases.

I think the base 10 model has made it more difficult to understand large numbers, and the only reason we hold onto it is out of tradition.

In attempt to understand which base would be better, I did analysis on the popularity of numbers.

Presumibly, the popularity of number use in texts should correspond with their order.

Sure, a few numbers can be more favorable to others, considered popular or lucky, but those would be considered anomalies. We'd expect most other numbers should continue to be in order.

Why should 10 be more popular than 9?

Why should 100 be more popular than 99?

Why should 1000 be more popular than 999?

My theory is that people will understand numbers better if they were closer to [subitizing limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing).

I looked up number popularity on [Google Ngram](https://books.google.com/ngrams)
